# 🧙‍♂️ Project Title: Untitled Spell-Based Exploration Game

> **Private Repository** – Prototype in Development

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

An open-world game (PC + Mobile) focused on deep exploration, strategic combat, and creative use of dual-purpose abilities. Inspired by the freedom of *Pokémon*, but with a strong focus on environmental interaction and high difficulty.

Players must master their spells, not only for combat but for solving puzzles and uncovering secrets in a dynamic, non-linear world.
